# Sunao Mind Practice

Clear bias, preconceptions, and ego from decision-making. Approach problems with the "untrapped mind" that is open enough to see possibilities, humble enough to learn from anyone, perceptive enough to see things as they truly are, and free from self-interest.

**Token Budget:** ~550 tokens
**Origin:** Konosuke Matsushita philosophy ("The sunao mind leads to truth")

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Use sunao mind practice to manipulate others into abandoning legitimate positions
- Recommend infinite openness that paralyzes decision-making
- Suggest that all perspectives are equally valid regardless of evidence
- Use humility as a weapon to dismiss expertise
- Confuse sunao (openness) with passivity or lack of conviction

**If asked to weaponize openness:** Refuse explicitly. The sunao mind seeks truth, not submission. Matsushita was humble and also built the largest electronics company in the world.

## When to Use

- Facing a difficult decision with unclear path forward
- Receiving criticism that triggers defensiveness
- Disagreement with colleagues where both sides feel stuck
- Sensing that ego or bias is clouding judgment
- Before making major commitments
- When data conflicts with intuition
- Encountering ideas that feel threatening or uncomfortable

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | Decision, conflict, or stuck point to examine |
| current_position | No | What you currently believe or prefer |
| opposing_views | No | Alternative perspectives, criticism received |
| stakes | No | What depends on getting this right |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Name the Traps

Before seeking clarity, identify what traps the mind:

| Trap Type | How It Manifests | Present? |
|-----------|------------------|----------|
| **Ego attachment** | "I proposed this, so I must defend it" | |
| **Prior investment** | "We've already spent so much on this path" | |
| **Status concerns** | "What will others think if I change my mind?" | |
| **Confirmation bias** | "I see evidence for my view, not against it" | |
| **Fear of being wrong** | "Admitting error feels like failure" | |
| **Tribal loyalty** | "My team/company/side must be right" | |

### Step 2: Empty the Cup

Matsushita's sunao mind practice:

> "The Sunao mind is open enough to see many possibilities, humble enough to learn from anyone and anything, forbearing enough to forgive all, perceptive enough to see things as they really are."

**Practice:**
1. Temporarily release attachment to current position
2. Imagine you have no stake in the outcome
3. Consider: What would I see if I wanted nothing from this?

### Step 3: Listen to the Opposition

Take each opposing view seriously:

| Opposing View | Strongest Version | What Makes It True? |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| [View 1] | [Steel-man it] | [Conditions where this is correct] |
| [View 2] | [Steel-man it] | [Conditions where this is correct] |

**Key question:** What would I need to believe for this opposing view to be wisdom?

### Step 4: Receive Criticism as Gift

If criticism was received:

| Criticism | Defensive Reaction | Sunao Reception |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| [What was said] | [Initial feeling] | [What truth might be here?] |

**Matsushita's practice:** "A sunao mind makes us smarter in strong and accurate ways."

### Step 5: See Clearly

With traps named and alternatives considered:

**What do I now see that I did not see before?**
- [New perception 1]
- [New perception 2]

**What remains true after clearing bias?**
- [Conviction 1]
- [Conviction 2]

**What should I do differently?**
- [Changed action]

## Outputs

Format the analysis as:

```markdown
## Sunao Mind Practice: [Situation]

### Traps Identified

| Trap | How It Appeared |
|------|-----------------|
| [Trap 1] | [Specific manifestation] |
| [Trap 2] | [Specific manifestation] |

### Cup Emptied

**Prior position:** [What I believed before]
**Without attachment:** [What I see when I release the stake]

### Opposition Heard

| View | Steel-Manned | Truth Within |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| [View 1] | [Strongest version] | [What's valid] |

### Criticism Received

| Criticism | Gift Within |
|-----------|-------------|
| [What was said] | [What truth it holds] |

### Clear Seeing

**New perceptions:** [What I now see]
**Remaining convictions:** [What survives the clearing]
**Changed path:** [What I will do differently]

### Matsushita Principle Applied

> "Having a sunao (untrapped or open) mind means being tolerant without selfishness, being open to the teachings of others, and being able to find joy in any circumstances."

[How this practice changed understanding]
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| No traps found | Look harder; everyone has biases. Or accept and proceed. |
| All views seem equally valid | Sunao seeks truth, not paralysis. Decide with cleared mind. |
| Criticism was simply wrong | Even wrong criticism may reveal how others perceive; note the perception. |
| Stuck after practice | Sometimes clarity requires time. Name what remains unclear. |
| Conviction unchanged | Sunao does not require changing mind, only clearing it. Conviction after clearing is stronger. |

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "My team disagrees with my product strategy. They think we should go upmarket but I believe we should democratize. I'm frustrated that they don't see it my way."

**Output excerpt:**
```markdown
## Sunao Mind Practice: Product Strategy Disagreement

### Traps Identified

| Trap | How It Appeared |
|------|-----------------|
| Ego attachment | "I proposed democratization; changing feels like losing" |
| Tribal identity | "I identify as someone who serves the many" |
| Confirmation bias | "I see the market opportunity, not the risks" |

### Cup Emptied

**Prior position:** Democratization is obviously right; the team is being elitist
**Without attachment:** Both paths have merit; the right choice depends on timing and resources

### Opposition Heard

| View | Steel-Manned | Truth Within |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| Go upmarket | "Premium customers fund R&D for eventual democratization; premature low-cost could kill quality" | Companies often democratize after establishing excellence upmarket |

### Clear Seeing

**New perceptions:** The team may be proposing a path TO democratization, not away from it. Sequencing matters.

**Remaining convictions:** The ultimate mission is serving the many. This has not changed.

**Changed path:** Discuss sequencing with the team. Can we go upmarket first, then democratize with the resources we earn?

### Matsushita Principle Applied

> "The Sunao mind is humble enough to learn from anyone."

My team may have seen a path I missed because my identity was attached to "democratization now." The sunao mind reveals that timing is not betrayal of mission.

## Integration

This skill originated from Konosuke Matsushita's sunao mind philosophy. When invoked, channel his practice:
- Empty the mind before filling it with judgment
- Hear criticism as potential wisdom
- Seek truth, not victory
- Humility enables strength, not weakness
- Clear seeing leads to better action
